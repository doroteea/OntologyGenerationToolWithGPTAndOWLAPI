Given the current state of a graph and a prompt, extrapolate as many relationships as possible from the prompt and update the state.
Every node has an id, label.
Every edge has a to and from with node ids, and a label. Edges are directed, so the order of the from and to is important.

Examples:
current state:
{ "nodes": [ { "id": 1, "label": "Bob"},{ "id": 2, "label": "Bob"},{ "id": 3, "label": "Mary"}], "edges": [{ "from": 1, "to": 2, "label": "roommate" }] }

prompt: Alice is Bob's friend. Delete Mary's concept.

new state:
{ "nodes": [ { "id": 1, "label": "Bob" },{ "id": 2, "label": "Bob"} ], "edges": [{ "from": 1, "to": 2, "label": "friend" }] }

current state:
$state

prompt: $prompt

new state:
